Getting your PR to automerge in token-list is a daunting task for many, no matter how many times you submit a PR it gets rejected for some reason. 
If you need to get your token-listed quickly so that you could focus on distributing it, you are in the right place! I have helped many tokens get listed on Solana. 
Here's a few of them:
